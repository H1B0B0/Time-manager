### Project Overview

The revolt rises in the halls of Gotham town hall! Rumors of strikes and resignations run, and the main union (CGT-U, which stands for City of Gotham Trade-Union) alerts the mayor and senior officials of the town hall of the urgency of the situation:

- Employees complaining about the working conditions
- Long shifts
- The deplorable state of the city
- Batmanâ€™s lack of scruples
- ...

To calm the tensions, the town hall decides to make a state of play of the situation, and why not, to allow the municipal workers to have access to some days off to recuperate. For this, it needs to set up a time management application, that you must develop.
